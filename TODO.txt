VITAL:
    WE need to code the huristic H* - the true distance between any solvable 8-puzzle and the solution 
        it can be done, the paper mentioned "retrograde analysis" - need to look into that 

    make an 8-puzzle problem into a full, orginized class etc...

    convert RTA* into our problem, not the maze problem

TODO:
    finish other huristic
    convert A8 into our problem 


Done:
    Generate all ~188,000 possible 8-puzzle combination as arr's
