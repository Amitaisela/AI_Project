            the RTA*, A*, and LRTA* are in Path_Finding.py

Huristic explanations:
    hstart - actual distance, meaning how many moves to get to the solution. We can use BFS in order to calculate this 
    manhattan_distance - sum of the manhattan distances of tiles that are not in there correct place.
    linear_conflict - two tiles are in linear conflict if: 
        1) they are in the same line ( row or column )
        2) there goal positions are in the same line
        3) tile 1 is on the right of tile 2
        4) the goal position of tile 1 is on the left of tile 2
        The actual huristic value is calculated as follows:
            in each row, calculate the number of tiles with linear conflict, minus 1.
            same for column
            add all, multiply by 2 and add the manhattan distance. this is the huristic value.
        
        Note that this huristic has a paper on it.
    misplaced_tiles - number of the misplaced tiles, basically the tiles that are not in their goal positions are counted.
    Gaschnig_relaxed_adjancey - the number of tiles that needs to be moved to reach the goal state if it were possible to swap any tile with the empty tile.


What is a correct decision?
    a correct decision is a decision of A* or RTA* to follow the H* path from a certain position.
